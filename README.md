  The code were given on this project included the .py support files (not included), and a good portion of base code. From there I wrote the Q-training algorithm, the reward system, and the neural network. After building all these, I then had to ensure that it worked of course.
  
computer scientists create and study code for further development and improvement of software and computer programs. It matters because of the development of new technology and the new software requirements they will need, in addition to the natural human tendency to continuously improve and develop newer better technologies for the sake of advancement. To approach a problem as a computer scientist, I need to first analyze the problem. I need to identify the requirements, judge possible ethical issues, plan proper builds, and ensure functionality. I have ethical resposibilities to ensire that the company hiring to do this gets a products, while being responsible that they get the data requested, and only that data as long as it coincides with laws set up for this matter.
